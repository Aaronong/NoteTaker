# The Problems

- Slide 1

We all take notes on a daily basis; be it a way to condense information from another source, organise our lives, or record our thoughts, we cannot deny the value of note-taking. However, a quick scan of your surroundings will reveal that many individual, even laptop owners, still choose not to use note-taking software. 

- Slide 2

Surveys have revealed that a third of laptop owners continue to use pen and paper for note taking. This suggests that there is a pronounced segment of the market who are willing to take notes on a software platform but feel that the current note-taking software offerings are not good enough. 

#### Why can't we just stick to handwritten notes?

- Slide 3

While handwritten notes offer the most in terms of flexibility, individuals who predominantly take their notes using software have cited the difficulty of information retrieval, and the inability to edit mistakes as key reasons not to use handwritten notes. Hand written notes are also difficult to share, and impossible to collaborate on. 



# Why existing solutions are not cutting it

- Slide 4

When we think of note-taking software, a few big providers come to mind. Google docs, microsoft words, Evernote, OneNote. The common critique is that while most of these document editors provide an excellent set of features for users to write documents, they are not suitable platforms for note-taking. Note-taking is a very different process. With note taking, there is no need for a rich set of features. Platforms only need to offer a minimal amount of features but make them readily accessible.

Within the list, Evernote stands out as a tool that offers the best mix of features and convenience for note-taking. Even then, there many of the problems that I will discuss later in this presentation will apply to Evernote as well.

### Inconvenience of typing notes

- Slide 5

Individuals who hand write their notes cited unintuitive shortcuts and the lack of shortcuts for key features such as colour coding and text highlighting as the largest stumbling block to the usability of note-taking applications. Popular features such as colour coding and text highlighting must be available for shortcut binding. Unfortunately, none of the note-taking software giants have responded to this pressing need yet. 

### Ineffective information retrieval across documents

- Slide 6

Note-taking is all about information. It serves as a way to record information from temporal sources and condense important information that individuals enticipate they will require in the future.  

While users have been satisfied searching through multiple documents to find the information they need, they now find information retrieval a cumbersome process and want a way to retrieve all related snippets of information across multiple documents more effectively. Five out of seven YNC students interviewed have expressed difficulty in retrieving information from their self-written notes.



### Poor support for collaborative note-taking

- Slide 7

Note-taking is becoming an increasingly collaborative process. My observations revealed that users are dissatistied with the current set of collaborative features offered on note-taking platforms. Firstly, users want a way to discern the authorship of written content more clearly. As the authorship of the content affects the credibility and attention that we give to it. Secondly, users experience a lack of control over the content that they have written in collaborative documents. Parts that they have written in collaborative documents have dissapeared without a trace, or have been modified without their consent. While the onus is on team to communicate more effectively, many users view the ability to provide read and write access to different parts of a shared document a useful feature to have.



### Solution?

- Slide 8

Now you must be wondering if there is a solution to all these. Lo and behold. The solution exists.

- The solution is? â€¦  SEEKY NOTES!

Find it inconvenient to type?

- We offer customizable shortcut binding

Cant find the information you need?

- We perform section searches that will pull out only relevant sections of each document for you. All displayed in a single view. 

Can't figure out who wrote what?

- We tag each content to its author and display it in a clear manner for you to see.

Who changed my part?

- We provide each collaborator with the ability to set read/write and comment access to the sections that they have written.

## Low fidelity prototype

- Slide 9

How does seeky notes achieve this?

- Click for docs to appear

Here at seeky notes, we believe that documents are far too large and clunky. We want to empower users to perform section searches and aggregate everything together on the same view.

Users can sort sections according to its author, document, or date.

Each section comes with a full set of permission settings.



# Low fidelity

- Slide 10

Here at seeky notes we develop our low fidelity prototypes through a rigorous iterative process to ensure that only the best of designs make it to the development phase.

We understand that while novelty is good, users switching over to our software would want to experience minimal disruption in their workflow. As such, we based our design on popular document writing software such as Google Docs and Evernote.

We were also impressed with the simple and effective user interface offered by Trello and found that its boards, lists, and cards structure is rather similar to the notebooks, documents, and notes structure that Seeky notes is proposing. Hence, we also decided to implement a Trello inspired dashboard.
