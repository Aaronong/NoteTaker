# The Problems

- Slide 1

We all take notes on a daily basis; be it a way to condense information from another source, organise our lives, or record our thoughts, we cannot deny the value of note-taking. However, a quick scan of your surroundings will reveal that many individual, even laptop owners, still choose not to use note-taking software. 

- Slide 2

Surveys have revealed that a third of laptop owners continue to use pen and paper for note taking. This suggests that there is a pronounced segment of the market who are willing to take notes on a software platform but feel that the current note-taking software offerings are not good enough. 

#### Why can't we just stick to handwritten notes?

- Slide 3

While handwritten notes offer the most in terms of flexibility, individuals who predominantly take their notes using software have cited the difficulty of information retrieval, and the inability to edit mistakes as key reasons not to use handwritten notes. Hand written notes are also difficult to share, and impossible to collaborate on. 



# Why existing solutions are not cutting it

- Slide 4

When we think of note-taking software, a few big providers come to mind. Google docs, microsoft words, Evernote, OneNote. The common critique is that while most of these document editors provide an excellent set of features for users to write documents, they are not suitable platforms for note-taking. Note-taking is a very different process. With note taking, there is no need for a rich set of features. Platforms only need to offer a minimal amount of features but make them readily accessible.

Within the list, Evernote stands out as a tool that offers the best mix of features and convenience for note-taking. Even then, there many of the problems that I will discuss later in this presentation will apply to Evernote as well.

### Inconvenience of typing notes

- Slide 5

Individuals who hand write their notes cited unintuitive shortcuts and the lack of shortcuts for key features such as colour coding and text highlighting as the largest stumbling block to the usability of note-taking applications. Popular features such as colour coding and text highlighting must be available for shortcut binding. Unfortunately, none of the note-taking software giants have responded to this pressing need yet. 

### Ineffective information retrieval across documents

- Slide 6

Note-taking is all about information. It serves as a way to record information from temporal sources and condense important information that individuals enticipate they will require in the future.  

While users have been satisfied searching through multiple documents to find the information they need, they now find information retrieval a cumbersome process and want a way to retrieve all related snippets of information across multiple documents more effectively. Five out of seven YNC students interviewed have expressed difficulty in retrieving information from their self-written notes.



### Poor support for collaborative note-taking

- Slide 7

Note-taking is becoming an increasingly collaborative process. My observations revealed that users are dissatistied with the current set of collaborative features offered on note-taking platforms. Firstly, users want a way to discern the authorship of written content more clearly. As the authorship of the content affects the credibility and attention that we give to it. Secondly, users experience a lack of control over the content that they have written in collaborative documents. Parts that they have written in collaborative documents have dissapeared without a trace, or have been modified without their consent. While the onus is on team to communicate more effectively, many users view the ability to provide read and write access to different parts of a shared document a useful feature to have.



### Solution?

- Slide 8

Now you must be wondering if there is a solution to all these. Lo and behold. The solution exists.

- The solution is? â€¦  SEEKY NOTES!

Find it inconvenient to type?

- We offer customizable shortcut binding

Cant find the information you need?

- We perform section searches that will pull out only relevant sections of each document for you. All displayed in a single view. 

Can't figure out who wrote what?

- We tag each content to its author and display it in a clear manner for you to see.

Who changed my part?

- We provide each collaborator with the ability to set read/write and comment access to the sections that they have written.

## Low fidelity prototype

- Slide 9

How does seeky notes achieve this?

- Click for docs to appear

Here at seeky notes, we believe that documents are far too large and clunky. We want to empower users to perform section searches and aggregate everything together on the same view.

Users can sort sections according to its author, document, or date.

- Click

Each section comes with a full set of permission settings.



# Low fidelity

- Slide 10

Here at seeky notes we develop our low fidelity prototypes through a rigorous iterative process to ensure that only the best of designs make it to the development phase.

- click

We understand that while novelty is good, users switching over to our software would want to experience minimal disruption in their workflow. As such, we based our design on popular document writing software such as Google Docs and Evernote. 

- click

We were also impressed with the simple and effective user interface offered by Trello and found that its boards, lists, and cards structure is rather similar to the notebooks, documents, and notes structure that Seeky notes is proposing. Hence, we also decided to implement a Trello inspired dashboard.

# Appendix



My observations revealed that most users experience a lack of control over the content that they have written in collaborative documents. Parts that they have written in collaborative documents have dissapeared without a trace, or have been modified without their consent. While the onus is on team to communicate more effectively, many users view the ability to provide read and write access to different parts of a shared document a useful feature to have.

```python
leverage upon the note-centric model to support collaborative access rights on both the document and the note level. Document level read access would allow a collaborator to read all notes within a shared document. Document level write access would allow a collaborator to create new notes and change the order of notes within the document. 
Collaborators who chose to create a note within a shared document would have the option to give read, annotate, or write access to other collaborators working on the shared document. Collaborators who are given write access to a note is able to modify the note directly. They are only limited from deleting the note and sharing its access rights. Collaborators who are given annotate access can drop comment bubbles on the note and suggest edits that the author has to approve or reject. 
```

### problem with evernote

- Each document has so many tags. And 90% of a document consists of information not related to the tag. We want to hide away unneccessary information.

### Problem with Google Docs

- Addresses collaborative document writing well but not really note-taking.

```python
The biggest reason cited as to why individuals are not switching over to note-taking software is that 

- Slide with all the logos, google docs, evernote, one note

- Provide 4 shortcuts, for pencolour 1, 2, 3, 4, highlight 1,2,3,4

- Handwritten too slow
- Most software are too well developed. Long feature list that makes it more difficult for you to use the note.
- Lack of good collaborative note-taking tools.
-  Hence everyone is using different things.
- Software lacks flexibility.
```



### Design Inspiration

The inspiration for my prototypes comes mainly from three applications: Google Docs, Evernote, andTrello. First and foremost, I wish for users to experience minimal disruptionin their workflow. Since Google Docs captures the largest market share in thecollaborative note-taking industry, design principles that align with GoogleDocs will make it easier for users to transition towards my software.

Evernote is also amarket leader in the note-taking industry with a platform which is arguablymuch more powerful than that of Google Docs. While Evernote contains a rich setof features, few have found its user interface clunky. Since my note-takingsoftware also contains a rich set of features which are uncommon to itscompetitors, I choose to draw inspiration from Evernote, which I feel havemanaged the trade-off between complex features and usability well.

Trello is a collaborative tool that I use often with asimple and effective user interface. While Trello performs a differentfunction, I found that its boards, lists, and cards structure is rather similarto the notebooks, documents, and notes structure that I am proposing. Ipersonally found the user flow of creating, managing, and reading boards,lists, and cards very intuitive in Trello and wish to apply some of its designprinciples in my software.

```python

```



### Document Parchment

I first designed the document parchment, which I felt was the most crucial element of the note-taking software that users would interact with. While document parchment design is fairly standard across applications in the market, I was introducinga new note-centric paradigm and hence had the task to distinguish between each note clearly without sacrificing the readability of the document. The first iteration of my document parchment design can be found in Appendix C. 

While I was fairly satisfied with how the colour coding and bordering of the prototype made the authorship and demarcation of each note clear, I still felt dissatisfied withthe prototype. Firstly, it does not offer a way for authors to change the access rights of their notes. Secondly, users do not always want view the authors of notes in the top right corner, especially in the case where there is no collaboration involved in the notebook/document. In the case where users are performing tag searches they might want to view the notebook/documentinformation of the note instead.

# Appendix



```python
A possible solution is to make shortcuts configurable and increase the range of functions that can be bound to shortcuts. Popular features such as colour coding and text highlighting must be available for shortcut binding. 
```

For note taking, you need a few colours quickly available, they help you to structure your content. Let us port over the biggest advantage of taking hand written notes over to software first. 

```python
- Provide 4 shortcuts, for pencolour 1, 2, 3, 4
- Provide shortcut for changing font size
```



```
- Seeky notes draws its inspiration from how databases function. Relational databases were born from the understanding that we do not always want to view data in the order that we key them in, we want to sort them according to parameters that we deem are important and hide irrelevant entries. 
- Seeky notes that note-taking would benefit from a similar approach. While we continue to write notes in the same way, we could benefit from the ability to view notes in different ways.
