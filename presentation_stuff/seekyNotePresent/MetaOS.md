# DOCKER but with a customizable IDE

# Meta OS, extending beyond Operating systems

- problem, many ppl find it difficult to distribute systems using multiple dependencies, screws each other up.

  - things like python virtual env
  - virtual machines,
  - and most recently Docker!!

  Docker is a great solution. It encapsulates what ppl is looking for. A fully independent environment for running any kinda code. But some ppl find it difficult to use. Why dont be build a front-end on top of it. Even better, make a framework for ppl to develop docker front-ends as well as back-end.


- Make a customizable ide for docker. 



## first tool

- providing a ide for docker images.
- runs like a mini desktop on the system - draw inspiration from raspbian.
- Extending docker images. Having a kinda base OS, that is extensible with a docker image. 

## Second tool

- Framework for making mini-docker OSes. Modifies the front end. 
- Backend always linux.
